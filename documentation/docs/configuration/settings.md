## Time Blocks Section

Time blocks define reusable durations for scheduled activities. Each time block triggers both start and end notifications.

### Common Time Blocks

```toml
[time_blocks]
pomodoro = 25           # 25-minute work sessions
long_break = 40         # 40-minute breaks
short_break = 5         # 5-minute short breaks
meeting = 50            # 50-minute meetings
exercise = 30           # 30-minute exercise sessions
lunch = 60              # 1-hour lunch break
napping = 30            # 30-minute naps
deep_work = 90          # 90-minute deep work sessions
```

### Custom Time Blocks

You can define any time block that suits your routine:

```toml
[time_blocks]
coding = 45             # 45-minute coding sessions
reading = 20            # 20-minute reading sessions
meditation = 15         # 15-minute meditation
standup = 15            # 15-minute standup meetings
review = 30             # 30-minute review sessions
planning = 20           # 20-minute planning sessions
```

## Time Points Section

Time points define reusable messages for one-time reminders.

### Common Time Points

```toml
[time_points]
go_to_bed = "Time to wind down and get ready for bed 😴"
summary_time = "Great work today! Time to summarize your accomplishments 🎉"
wake_up = "Good morning! Time to start your day 🌅"
lunch_time = "Lunch time! Take a break and nourish yourself 🍽️"
stretch_time = "Time to stand up and stretch your body 🧘"
hydrate = "Remember to drink some water 💧"
```

### Custom Time Points

Create time points that match your routine:

```toml
[time_points]
check_email = "Time to check and respond to emails 📧"
daily_standup = "Daily standup meeting starts now 👥"
code_review = "Time to review pull requests 🔍"
retrospective = "Sprint retrospective meeting 📝"
demo_time = "Demo time! Show your work 🎬"
retrospect = "Time to reflect on your day 🤔"
```

## Task Settings Section (Optional)

Configure task management behavior:

```toml
[task_settings]
max_tasks = 100                 # Maximum number of tasks
default_importance = 5          # Default importance level (1-10)
auto_cleanup_days = 30          # Auto-cleanup completed tasks after N days
show_completed = false          # Show completed tasks in list
```

sound_file = "/System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff"
sound_file = "/System/Library/Sounds/Hero.aiff"
